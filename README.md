# OpenMap
Java library used read/write shapefiles. This is a stripped down version of the official [OpenMap Project](https://github.com/OpenMap-java/openmap).
All we have done here is to strip away all the rendering and UI code and provide a simple library to read and write shapefiles.


# Usage
The primary interface to the shapefile reader/writer is the ShapeFile class.
Here's an example of how to invoke the class. You can pass in any one of the shapefile files (shp, dbf, shx).

``` java
package openmap;
import java.util.*;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

        ShapeFile shp = new ShapeFile(new java.io.File(args[0]));
        System.out.println("Found " + shp.getRecordCount() + " records in the shapefile");

        Iterator<Record> it = shp.getRecords();
        while (it.hasNext()){
            Record record = it.next();
            for (Field field : record.getFields()){
                System.out.print(field.getValue() + "\t");
            }
            System.out.println();
            if (true) break;
        }
    }
}
```


# Dependencies
This library relies on [JTS](https://github.com/locationtech/jts) to represent
geometries (point, line, polygon, etc). 


# Java Compatibility
This library has been tested and used with Java 1.8 and up.
